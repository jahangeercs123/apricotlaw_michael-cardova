                    <p>Even though you try to avoid accidents, you can be injured because another person wasn’t watching
                        out for your safety. Whether it was a <span class="yellow-color"> slip-and-fall,</span> a <span

                    <p>Filing a <span class="yellow-color"> personal injury claim or lawsuit in Phoenix </span>is not
                        something the average person can do on their own. There are complex laws that can affect your
                        case, as well as difficult negotiations and paperwork you will have to complete. You must also
                        accurately calculate your losses, investigate the accident, and collect evidence to prove
                        negligence.</p>
                    <p>You deserve to have the help of a dedicated, meticulous legal professional who can guide you
                        through every step of the Phoenix personal injury claim process. You should be able to focus on
                        recovering from your injuries and getting back to work. That’s why it’s important for you to
                        reach out to a Phoenix injury lawyer at the Law Offices of Michael Cordova.</p>
                    <p>Don’t delay in calling a lawyer at our office. Most Arizona injury cases require you to submit
                        your claim within two years of the date of your accident. Failure to submit your claim within
                        this time frame will prevent you and your family from receiving the compensation you’re owed.

                <div class="practice-area-right">
                    <h6>Car Accidents</h6>
                    <p>Vehicle collisions are a leading cause of injuries and death in the Phoenix area. Fight back
                        against a reckless or careless driver by filing a car crash claim against them.</p>
                    <h6>Truck Accidents</h6>
                    <p>
                        Commercial trucks can cause catastrophic injuries and devastating life changes for the victims
                        involved. A trucking company, trucker, loading company, or parts manufacturer could be liable
                        for your truck accident.
                    </p>
                    <h6>Medical Malpractice</h6>
                    <p>When a doctor caused you harm because of subpar medical treatment, they can be held responsible
                        for harming you. Medical negligence claims can also prevent others in Phoenix from being harmed
                        by a careless doctor.</p>
                    <h6>Premises Liability</h6>
                    <p>Property owners have the responsibility of maintaining a safe property for guests and visitors.
                        If a hazard on someone’s property went unaddressed and led to your injury, you can file a claim.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="practice-area-left">
                    <h6>Dog Bites</h6>
                    <p>Dog owners must be held accountable when they fail to restrain their pets. When a dangerous dog
                        has injured you, you have every right to file a claim to receive damages.
                    </p>
                    <h6>Product Injuries</h6>
                    <p>Dangerous products can cause serious injuries, and you can hold a negligent manufacturer
                        accountable for your suffering. An attorney can investigate the product that caused you harm and
                        do what’s possible to hold the manufacturer legally responsible.
                    </p>
                    <h6>Motorcycle Accidents</h6>
                    <p>
                        Many people don’t watch out for motorcyclists, and you can be seriously injured as a result.
                        Make sure a negligent driver or other responsible party doesn’t go unpunished for causing your
                        motorcycle crash.

                    </p>
                    <h6>Wrongful Death</h6>
                    <p>
                        Your beloved family member would still be here today if not for the careless or wrongful act of
                        another. Receive justice for your loved one by filing a wrongful death claim.

                <h3>WHY SHOULD YOU WORK WITH OUR FIRM?</h3>
                <p>Call to talk with a lawyer during a free evaluation and find out how much your Phoenix injury case
                    could be worth. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="artical-pragraph">
                <p>There are a great many injury lawyers in Phoenix and the surrounding areas, so how do you know that
                    you’ve found the right one for you? You want a Phoenix personal injury lawyer who will listen to
                    your concerns and will fight for the compensation rightfully owed to you.</p>
                <p>When you partner with the Law Offices of Michael Cordova, you will be gaining the knowledge and
                    proficiency of a legal professional with the compassion of a social worker. You deserve to have a
                    lawyer who wants to see you secure the justice you deserve for an accident you didn’t cause.</p>
                <p>Many attorneys will make you promises that they can’t keep. We won’t do that. We can guarantee that
                    every effort possible will be made to investigate your case, prove liability, and get you the full
                    compensation owed to you—and not a cent less. </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, our firm will work out a contingency fee arrangement with you. That means that you
                    won’t pay us anything at all until after your Phoenix lawyer has won you the settlement you need.
                    There is no reason for you to wonder whether you have a case or how much your case might be
                    worth—call to find out.

                    <h3>Why You Can File a Claim When Someone Else Has Harmed You</h3>
                    <p>The reason you are able to file a personal injury claim when you’ve been hurt in an accident you
                        didn’t cause is because of Arizona’s negligence laws. The idea is that if someone else’s actions
                        were responsible for causing you to be injured, they should be required to compensate you for
                        what you went through. This law goes for unintentional injuries, as well. </p>
                    <p>For instance, if you are walking down the grocery store aisle and you slipped on a spill a worker
                        left on the floor, the store worker who left the spill on the floor and the company should be
                        held responsible. They likely didn’t leave the spill there with the intention of causing you
                        harm, but they were still responsible for your injuries.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="upper-row-right-col">
                    <h3>Who Pays Out on Personal Injury Claims?</h3>
                    <p>When someone has injured you, you deserve to receive justice and compensation for what you have
                        been through. Unfortunately, negligent people don’t always have the money to pay for your
                        injuries and losses, even if they should be paying. Insurance was created as a way to protect
                        injury victims financially when careless people cause you to be hurt</p>
                    <p>Property owners, vehicle drivers, businesses, and even the government usually have insurance
                        policies so that when injuries and accidents do occur, the victims can receive monetary
                        compensation. When you’ve been injured, it’s likely the at-fault party’s insurer that will be
                        paying your settlement.</p>

                <h3>Winning the Settlement You Need for Your Accident</h3>
                <p>One of the questions our firm often receives: What types of losses are included in an injury claim?
                    You already know how much an accident and possible injuries can affect a life, because it’s already
                    happening to you.</p>
                <p>You might be dealing with hospital bills, other medical expenses, lost income, and other financial
                    losses. You are likely also struggling through the pain of your injuries and emotional and mental
                    trauma caused by the accident, and you could be facing permanent injury or disfiguring scars. You
                    can add all losses that this accident has caused you to suffer to your personal injury claim.</p>

                <h2>Phoenix Personal Injury </h2>
                <h1>FAQ</h1>
                <p>Many people have questions when they begin looking into filing an injury claim in Phoenix. When you
                    contact our firm directly, you can receive case-specific answers during a free initial evaluation.
                    However, to get a general idea of how the personal injury claim process works, here are a few common
                    questions our law firm receives. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-bottom">
                <h5>How long do I have to submit a personal injury claim in Arizona?</h5>
                <p>For most types of personal injury cases in Arizona, you are given two years to file your claim. The
                    clock starts the day of your accident. You don’t want to wait, though, because two years flies by a
                    lot faster than many people think. In addition, the faster you file your claim, the better chance
                    you have that witnesses won’t disappear or evidence won’t get lost.</p>
                <h5>Will I have to go to court to win a settlement?</h5>
                <p>Most likely you will not need to set foot into a courtroom in order to win the settlement you
                    deserve. Most Phoenix injury cases are settled outside of the courtroom. However, if it ever came to
                    going to court to win the compensation you’re owed, your attorney at our firm will be ready to
                    battle it out for you.</p>
                <h5>What are economic and non-economic damages?</h5>
                <p>All the monetary losses you’ve suffered as a result of your accident are often referred to as
                    economic damages. These damages include things like medical bills, lost wages, costs of caregiving
                    services, and property loss. Non-economic damages refer to any negative effect of your accident not
                    tied to financial loss. For instance, pain and suffering are non-economic damages.</p>
                <h5>Is it really necessary for me to work with a lawyer?</h5>
                <p>Some claims can be filed without legal assistance, but it’s not usually a good idea. Your lawyer
                    offers you invaluable legal know-how and experience. Working with a lawyer allows you to receive a
                    settlement while your focus remains on what matters most—your health.</p>
                <h5>What if I don’t have the money to pay a lawyer?</h5>
                <p>A lot of injury victims try to file claims on their own because they think they can’t afford an
                    attorney. You should know that our firm is happy to work out a contingency fee arrangement with you.
                    This is when your lawyer only gets paid for their services after they’ve won you the full settlement
                    you deserve.</p>
                <p>You have every right to be upset when you’ve been injured because another person didn’t take your
                    safety seriously. Unfortunately, the only way to receive justice and financial compensation for what
                    you’ve been through is through the personal injury claim process. Filing a case may seem
                    intimidating, but that’s where your lawyer can help.</p>
                <p>A Phoenix personal injury lawyer with the Law Offices of Michael Cordova can focus on winning you the
                    settlement you need. You can focus on healing physically and mentally from this accident and your
                    injuries. To reach our firm, call <span class="yellow-color"> 602-265-6700 </span>or complete the
